# SpyGraph
This is a project I did for data structure class. Instead of a recursive DFS, which is the usual way to do it, I implemented it in a non-recursive way, which can save memories. BDF and DFS algorithms can be found in SpyGraph.java

This is an interactive game in which you are going to catch a randomly-moving spy. You can run the main class (Game.java) using command-line argument Config(number).txt Area(number).txt

The Neighbor.java Player.java SpyGraph.java GraphNode.java classes were implemented by me. I used eclipse to edit my code.
